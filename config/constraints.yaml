# Description and notes

  Consolidated robot configuration file for RB3-730ES-U robot.

  All spatial dimensions are in meters (SI units) for consistency.
  All angular dimensions are in degrees and converted to radians internally.

  IMPORTANT: Joint limits are configured for production use with tools/grippers attached.
  J5 and J6 limits are conservative to account for:
  - Tool/gripper geometry and collision avoidance
  - Cable management (power, pneumatic, communication cables)
  - Mechanical stress on wrist joints when carrying payload
  - Practical accessibility for maintenance and operation

  Coordinate system:
  - X: Forward(+) / Backward(-) from robot base
  - Y: Right(+) / Left(-) from robot base  
  - Z: Up(+) / Down(-) from robot base

  Safety margins create a smaller "safe zone" within the physical boundaries
  to account for robot dynamics, sensor noise, and mechanical tolerances.

  TOOL COORDINATE SYSTEMS:
  - TCP (Tool Center Point): The robot's native end-effector reference point
  - Tool Functional Point: The actual working point of the attached tool
  - For grippers: Usually the center point between fingers when closed
  - Tool offset transforms TCP coordinates to functional coordinates
