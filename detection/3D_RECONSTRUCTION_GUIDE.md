# SAM2 dependencies  
pip install torch torchvision segment-anything-2
```

## 🎯 Capture Setup

### 1. Environment Preparation
```
✅ Clear, uncluttered background
✅ Consistent lighting (avoid direct sunlight/shadows)
✅ Stable surface for object placement
✅ Mark object position (tape/marker on table)
✅ Camera tripod/mount ready
```

### 2. Object Positioning
```
• Place object in CENTER of capture area
• Mark position with tape/marker
• Object should be 0.5-0.8m from camera
• Ensure object fits completely in camera frame
• ⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT MOVE OBJECT during capture session
```

### 3. Camera Configuration
```
• RealSense resolution: 848×480 (RGB + Depth)
• Frame rate: 30 FPS
• Depth alignment: RGB aligned
• Auto-exposure enabled
• Depth range: 0.3-3.0 meters
```

## 📷 Correct Capture Process

### ❌ WRONG METHOD (What NOT to do):
```
❌ Fixed camera + moving object
❌ Random object positions  
❌ Inconsistent distances
❌ Poor lighting changes
❌ Large gaps between captures
```

### ✅ CORRECT METHOD: Orbital Camera Capture

#### Phase 1: Eye-Level Capture (12 shots)
```
Camera at same height as object center:

Position sequence (every 30°):
• 0° (front of object)
• 30°, 60°, 90° (right side)
• 120°, 150°, 180° (back)
• 210°, 240°, 270° (left side)  
• 300°, 330° (return to front)

Distance: Keep consistent 0.6-0.8m from object
```

#### Phase 2: High-Angle Capture (12 shots)
```
Camera 30° above object (looking down):

Same 30° increments around object:
• Captures top surfaces, rim, handle connections
• Important for cup/mug: interior view, rim details
• Maintains same horizontal distances
```

#### Phase 3: Low-Angle Capture (12 shots)
```
Camera 30° below object (looking up):

Same 30° increments around object:
• Captures bottom surfaces, base details
• Important for stability/sitting surface
• May need to tilt object slightly (keep position marked)
```

#### Total: 36 Systematic Captures

### 🔄 Capture Execution Steps

#### 1. Start Capture System
```bash
cd /path/to/dynamic
python3 -m detection.capture.realsense_yolo_848x480
```

#### 2. Manual Positioning Method
```
For each of the 36 positions:

1. Move camera to position (keep object stationary)
2. Frame object in viewfinder
3. Wait for YOLO detection (green box around object)
4. Hold steady for auto-capture (every 3 seconds)
5. Verify depth data quality (no black holes in object area)
6. Move to next position
```

#### 3. Quality Checks During Capture
```
✅ Object always in same world position
✅ Each view shows 20-30% overlap with adjacent views
✅ No completely isolated viewpoints
✅ All object surfaces visible from at least 2-3 angles
✅ Handle/spout captured from multiple perspectives
✅ Clean depth data (minimal noise/holes)
```

## 🔄 Data Processing Pipeline

### Step 1: Verify Capture Data
```bash
# Check captured data structure
ls detection/captures/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_*/

# Should contain:
# - rgb.jpg (color image)
# - depth.png (depth image) 
# - mask.png (SAM2 segmentation)
# - metadata.json (camera intrinsics, detections)
```

### Step 2: Generate Individual Point Clouds
```bash
# Create point clouds from each capture
python3 -m detection.reconstruction.point_cloud_generator

# Output: detection/clouds/*.ply files (one per capture)
```

### Step 3: Multi-View Registration
```bash
# Register and align all point clouds
python3 -m detection.reconstruction.multiview_registration

# Output:
# - merged_registered.ply (all views)
# - merged_high_quality.ply (filtered best views)
# - registration_metadata.json (quality scores)
```

### Step 4: Quality Assessment
```bash
# Compare results and visualize
python3 -m detection.reconstruction.results_comparison
```

## 📊 Quality Assessment

### Registration Quality Metrics
```
🏆 Excellent (>0.9):   Perfect alignment
✅ Good (0.6-0.9):      Acceptable quality
⚠️  Poor (0.1-0.6):     Marginal alignment  
❌ Bad (≤0.1):         Failed registration
```

### Expected Results for Good Capture
```
✅ 20-30 point clouds with fitness > 0.6
✅ Complete object surface coverage
✅ Smooth surface transitions
✅ Proper object proportions
✅ No major missing parts/holes
```

### Visual Quality Indicators
```
Good reconstruction:
• Coherent object shape
• Smooth surface continuity
• Proper scale/proportions
• Complete surface coverage
• Clean edges and boundaries

Poor reconstruction:
• Scattered point clouds
• Missing object parts
• Unrealistic proportions  
• Surface discontinuities
• Excessive noise/outliers
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Poor Registration (Low Fitness Scores)
```
Causes:
• Object moved during capture
• Too much distance between viewpoints
• Insufficient surface overlap
• Poor depth data quality

Solutions:
• Recapture with fixed object method
• Reduce angle increments (15° instead of 30°)
• Improve lighting conditions
• Check camera calibration
```

### Problem: Missing Object Parts
```
Causes:
• Incomplete viewing angles
• Self-occlusion issues
• SAM2 segmentation gaps
• Depth sensor limitations

Solutions:
• Add more capture angles
• Use enhanced point cloud generation modes
• Manual mask correction
• Multiple capture sessions with different orientations
```

### Problem: Noisy Point Clouds
```
Causes:
• Poor lighting conditions
• Reflective surfaces
• Depth sensor noise
• Movement during capture

Solutions:
• Improve lighting setup
• Use matte spray on reflective objects
• Increase capture distance
• Use statistical outlier removal
```

## 🎯 Best Practices Summary

### Capture Phase
1. **Fixed object, moving camera** (not the reverse)
2. **Systematic 30° increments** for complete coverage
3. **Multiple elevation angles** (eye-level, high, low)
4. **Consistent camera distance** (0.6-0.8m)
5. **Verify real-time** (depth quality, YOLO detection)

### Processing Phase
1. **Check capture data** before processing
2. **Use enhanced point cloud modes** for better coverage
3. **Apply multi-view registration** for alignment
4. **Filter by quality scores** (use high-quality output)
5. **Visual verification** of final results

### Quality Validation
1. **Registration fitness > 0.6** for most captures
2. **Complete surface coverage** verification
3. **Realistic object proportions** check
4. **Surface continuity** assessment
5. **Compare with reference objects** if available

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Practice run**: Do a few test captures to verify setup
- **Backup strategy**: Capture extra angles if unsure
- **Lighting consistency**: Avoid changing light conditions mid-session
- **Camera stability**: Use tripod/mount for consistent positioning
- **Object choice**: Start with matte, non-reflective objects
- **Patience**: Take time for systematic, quality captures

*This pipeline produces high-quality 3D reconstructions when the capture process is followed correctly. The key is systematic, overlapping captures with a fixed object reference frame.*
